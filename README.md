# internal_carotid_arteries_diameter_analysis  
Taking a spreadsheet of carotid radii over length, which is acquired by segmenting carotid CT scans, calculate the change in radii to find stenotic pathologies.  
  
Credit to Scott Collins for the clinical workflow, segmentations, further data processing resulting in the spreadsheets (not included), and post-automation data processing.
